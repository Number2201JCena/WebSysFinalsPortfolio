            <h2>8-Bit Binary Game</h2>
            <p>- A simple game that teaches you to calculate binary numbers as fast as you can.</p>
            <p>- The main goal of the game is to add up the values such that it adds up to the displayed number at the center-top of the screen before the timer runs out. You must answer every box with either a 1 (for yes) or 0 (for no)</p>
            <p>- Answering correctly gives you a point and resets the timer, but this reset gives you less and less time per sucessful answer</p>
            <P>- Get as much points as possible!</P>
