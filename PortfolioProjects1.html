        <h2>Encrypter and Decrypter</h2>
        <p>- A program that has two functions, encrypting and decrypting.</p>
        <p>- When choosing to encrypt, you first create a key.
             This key will be used to make the cypher alphabet needed to encrypt the message.
             The key makes this cypher alphabet by placing any unique letters in the spot before the first letter.
             Example: a key of "Dog" would place D, O, and G before A, after which alphabetical order applies, except the empty spots caused by this move will cause the letters to move up to fill it.
            The key isn't case and space-sensitive; with or without uppercase or space, it will work.</p>
        <p>- Then type in you message of choice and it will encrypt it in the cypher alphabet you've made as well as create a text file of it.</p>
        <p>- For decrypting, you simply type in the key used to encrypt it and it should be able to decrypt it into a readable state.</p>
