            <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
            <p>- A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where you face off against a CPU opponent. You play as O while CPU plays as X</p>
            <p>- You input your move by typing it in the provided format.
                 Despite what the images say, it's more accurate to say that you dictate how far your moves appear within the column or row.
                For example, 2-1 will mov your O down the column twice, then move it once to the right of the row it landed itself on.</p>
            <p>- Like normal Tic-Tac-Toe, if you get a 3-in-a-row with your symbol horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, you win.</p>
